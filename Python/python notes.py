##Operators and Expressions in Python.
#1. Aritmetic Operators.
#2. Comparison Operators(Relational).
#3. Assignment Operator.
#4. Logical Operator.
#5. Unary Operator.
#6. Bitwise Operator.
#7. Membership Operator.
#8. Identity Operator.

#1. Arithmetic Operator: +, -, *, /, //(floor division), **(exponent), %.
#2. Comparison Operator: ==, >=, <=,!=,>,<. All these operators return
#Boolean value, Either True or False.

#3. Assignment Operator and Inplace or Shortcut Operator:
#b=5
#a=b
#print(a)

##a=a+10
#x=20
#x+=10
#print(x)

#+=, -=, *=, /=, //=, %=, **=.

#y=10
#y**=3
#print(y)

#name='Rupak'
#name+=' Sarkar'
#print(name)

#Ternary Operator:
#x = a>b?a:b (For C)

#Bitwise Operator: & (AND), | (OR), ^ (X-OR), ~ (Bitwise NOT).

#Shift Operator:

#p=5
# print(p<<1)
#It will print the value by doubling the initial value.

#print(p>>1)
#It will reduce the value by dividing it by 2.
#q=15
#print(q>>1) # Output will be 7 (0111).

#Logical Operator: && (and), ||(or), !(not).

#Print the greatest of three numbers using logical operator.

a=10
b=20
c=30

if(a>b and a>c):
    print("a is the greatest.", a)
elif(b>a and b>c):
    print("b is the greatest.", b)
else:
    print("c is the greatest.", c)

# x++, x-- is not allowed in Python.

#Write a program to check whether a given year is leap year or not.

#Membership Operator:
#whether the element is present within the sequence or not is
#checked by the Membership Operator.
#in, not in.
#Membership operator will return TRUE or FALSE
#depending on the result.

#Types of Expression in Python:
#1. Based on the position of operator the expressions are evaluated.
#a. Infix Expression. (a+b)
#b. Prefix Expression. (+ab)
#c. Postfix Expression. (ab+)
#Based on Datatype:
#Constant, Floating, Relational, Logical, Assignment, Bitwise Expressions.
